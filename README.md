# CKD Detection and Progression Prediction

A deep learning project using CNNs and LSTMs to detect Chronic Kidney Disease and predict its progression, combining medical imaging and EHR data.

## Features
- CNN for feature extraction from images
- LSTM for sequential analysis from EHR
- End-to-end pipeline from preprocessing to prediction

## Folder Structure
- `data/` – contains datasets
- `models/` – model architecture
- `utils/` – data preprocessing
- `main.py` – main script

## Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
